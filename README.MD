Adds a version of `/tp` (`/bettertp`) with yaw and pitch controls for minecraft 1.7

The rotational arguments to the tp command were added in minecraft 1.8 and later, but they can be useful for cinematic purposes, like lining up camera angles to be in the same position across multiple shots.

Usage: `/bettertp [target player] <x> <y> <z> <yaw> <pitch>`
